Probabilistic Machine Learning
This course provides an overview of standard techniques and algorithms for data mining and machine learning. Students will be exposed to exploratory data analysis and data cleaning before surveying standard algorithms for classification and clustering. Additionally, students will learn the types of problems each algorithm is best suited to solve. Special attention will be given to efficiency and scalability. Students will apply algorithms to data sets from biology, chemistry, social media, and industry (Netflix Grand Challenge, etc.)
